# profile-page-v1

-This project is the first version of my profile page. It is based on the windows 11 theme since I LOVE microsoft so much =).

-Special features of version 1: 
  --> Sliding animation for the 'About Me', 'Hobbies' and 'Photos' section with rotating icons. 
  --> Caricature has eyes that follow the cursor and mouth opens when cursor hovers over.
  --> Clock shows real-time.
  --> Icons turn dark blue when hovered over. 
  
-The first version is not completely responsive so the formatting may be obstructed if the screen is resized. 

-Future development ideas: 
  --> Add items to the desktop such as other pictures or when I create more projects - links to projects
  --> Add extra functionality in taskbar for e.g. clicking on battery life shows something... or music playing ...
  --> Add functionality to search bar
  --> Possibly create slide show for 'Photos' section
